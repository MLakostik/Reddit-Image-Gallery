# Reddit Image Gallery

### Description
The Reddit image gallery uses the Reddit JSON API to pull all images and gifs from a specified subreddit. A request is made and the JSON file is pulled which allows us to get each of the image URLs. Each image link is then placed inside a `<img>` tag and is then appended to the page.

### Features
- Allows user to search for subreddit
- Hides all images that are broken
- A default subreddit can be set
- Uses the Materialize framework
